Installing
==========

After you clone/download, you'll need to include cocos2d-1.1 and correctly set the path to it with recursive.

TinyTimGames has a tutorial on doing precisely that:
http://www.tinytimgames.com/2011/07/22/cocos2d-and-arc/

Basically all you have to do is reset the search path to the place where your cocos2d libs and project reside.

Remember to rename the project accordingly, you probably don't want your game to be callend 'Template'.


P.S.: This is a very raw project so far, so I'm aware the documentation is far from perfect, but I'll get to that later :)
